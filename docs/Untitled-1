We would like to implement a parallel version of this implementation (key features of the current codebase are highlighted in `docs/codebase_overview.md`).
We will leave the existing implementation in place and create new files. Follow the instructions in @P2_web_research.md for this goal.

The new implementation will use the new google-genai SDK instead of anthropic (documentation can be found at https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/ and also here https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/text-generation).

Note that the SDK and its documentation has recently changed, so it is **very important to read the current documentation** to understand how to use it, and make sure we are using the latest version - you **CANNOT** use your existing knowledge here but must instead make sure to read the documentation, understand it, and document your findings, and use those in your implementation.
